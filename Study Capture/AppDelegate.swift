 Project: App
 Study Capture App
 
 Background
 Our clinical services team has come to us for help in developing an iPhone app for study capture. This app will allow a user to enter their subject id into a text box and capture a selfie image in portrait orientation with the front camera. The image will then need to have the subject’s id “burned in” to the lower right hand corner after having a core image filter applied, and then saved  to the camera roll.
 
 Goals
 The overall goal of this application is to allow the user to capture a selfie image to be later submitted for analysis.
 
 Constraints
 The subject id is alphanumeric.
 The subject id written into the image needs to be in a white font on a black rectangular background.
 The core image filter to be applied is a CIUnsharpMask with an input radius of 11 and an input intensity of 0.5.
 The workflow of the app is: Enter subject id – capture image – review image – process image – display result image.
 Display result image view needs to have a save button which will cause the displayed image to be saved to the camera roll.
 
 For extra credit, display a custom spinner that you have written in the center of the screen while the image is being processed.
